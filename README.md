## Howdy!
This is where I will be keeping all of my work in Natural Language Processing!

### Project 0:
I've written a [summary of NLP](overview-of-nlp.pdf), and what that means to me!

## Project 1: Basic Python
Just a [simple script](project-1/contact-parser.py) that shows off some basic text processing in python. If you would like to learn more, check out my [summary](project-1/summary.md).

## Project 2: POS Tagging and NLTK
Here we have a interactive [guessing game](project-2/guessing-game.py) where the words are taken from a text, tokenized, preprocessed, and the top 50 most common nouns are selected to be options for the guessing game.
